# Scalando

This repository contains the complete examples from the Scala Book: How to scale your productivity.

In the `src/main/resources` directory are scripts that help you run some of the examples. To run them, to go to the directory in question and run the script directly. For example, to run the first example of chapter 1 use the following commands:

```shell
cd src/main/resources/cap01/
./foto-java.sh
```

If the file cannot be executed, check if it has permissions to running on your machine.
